        <h2>Why we built Lernia</h2>
        <p>
          Studying abroad is one of the biggest decisions a student can make. It
          affects your finances, your career and your everyday life. Yet most of
          the time, the information is scattered across dozens of sites,
          brochures and spreadsheets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lernia was created to bring together academic offers, cost of living,
          and scholarship information in one, honest view. No rankings drama, no
          marketing hype just data to help you understand your options.
        </p>
        <p>
          Behind Lernia there is a team of students who faced these decisions
          themselves. Our goal is simple: make it easier for the next student to
          feel confident about their choice.
